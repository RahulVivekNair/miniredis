- Data Storage: Determine the type of storage mechanism you want to use for your key-value pairs. You might consider options such as in-memory storage for faster access or disk-based storage for persistence.

- Scalability: Determine whether your DBMS needs to handle a small or large amount of data and concurrent users. Consider if you need to support horizontal scaling (adding more servers) or vertical scaling (increasing the capacity of a single server).

- Concurrency Control: Define the level of concurrency you expect in your system. Consider if your DBMS should allow multiple threads or processes to read and write data simultaneously and how you will handle conflicts and ensure data consistency.
